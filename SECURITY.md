# Security Documentation

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Data Privacy
- ✅ **Local Storage Only**: All user data is stored locally in their browser
- ✅ **No Backend Database**: No server-side data storage
- ✅ **User Isolation**: Each user's data is completely separate
- ✅ **No Data Sharing**: Users cannot access each other's information

### Security Headers
- ✅ **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks
- ✅ **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- ✅ **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- ✅ **X-XSS-Protection**: Browser-level XSS protection
- ✅ **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information

### Code Security
- ✅ **No Sensitive Data in Code**: No API keys or passwords in source code
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Sensitive config uses .env files
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- ✅ **No Eval Usage**: No dangerous JavaScript execution

## 🛡️ How User Data is Protected

### Data Storage
```
User's Browser → Local Storage → Encrypted by Browser → Only accessible to that user
```

### Data Flow
1. User enters data in their browser
2. Data is stored in browser's local storage
3. Data is automatically encrypted by the browser
4. Only that specific browser/user can access the data
5. Data never leaves the user's device

### User Isolation
- Each browser session is completely independent
- No shared database or server
- No user accounts or authentication needed
- No way for users to access each other's data

## 🚀 Deployment Security Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Review all environment variables
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data in code
- [ ] Test in private/incognito mode
- [ ] Verify CSP headers work correctly
- [ ] Check that HTTPS is enforced (if using custom domain)

### After Deployment
- [ ] Test the live site functionality
- [ ] Verify security headers are present
- [ ] Confirm no console errors
- [ ] Test data persistence across sessions

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Data Isolation**: Open in two different browsers/devices
2. **Data Persistence**: Close and reopen browser
3. **Input Validation**: Try entering invalid data
4. **XSS Prevention**: Try injecting script tags

### Tools to Use
- **Lighthouse**: Run security audit
- **Security Headers**: Check headers at securityheaders.com
- **Browser DevTools**: Check for console errors

## 📋 Privacy Policy Considerations

Since this app stores data locally, you should include:
- Data is stored locally in user's browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- Users can clear their data anytime
- No tracking or analytics (unless you add them)

## 🚨 Important Notes

### What This App Does NOT Do
- ❌ Store data on external servers
- ❌ Share data between users
- ❌ Track users across sites
- ❌ Collect personal information
- ❌ Require user registration

### What This App DOES Do
- ✅ Store data locally in user's browser
- ✅ Provide personalized experience per user
- ✅ Allow users to manage their own credit card data
- ✅ Calculate optimal rewards for each user's cards

## 🔧 Future Security Enhancements

If you add features later, consider:
- User authentication (for data sync across devices)
- Data encryption before storage
- Backup/restore functionality
- Export/import capabilities
