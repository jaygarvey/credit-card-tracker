## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. **Go to [github.com](https://github.com)**
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Repository name**: `credit-card-tracker`
   - **Description**: "Credit Card Rewards Optimizer and Payment Tracker"
   - **Visibility**: Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Initialize**: Don't check any boxes (we'll upload existing code)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Upload Your Code**

**Option A: Using GitHub Desktop (Easiest)**
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Clone your new repository
3. Copy all files from `credit-card-tracker` folder into the cloned folder
4. Commit and push to GitHub

**Option B: Using Command Line**
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd credit-card-tracker

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Credit Card Tracker"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/credit-card-tracker.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Option C: Using GitHub Web Interface**
1. Click "uploading an existing file" on your new repo page
2. Drag and drop your entire `credit-card-tracker` folder
3. Commit the changes

### **Step 3: Update Homepage URL**

**Important**: You need to update the homepage URL in `package.json`:

1. **Open `package.json`**
2. **Find this line:**
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/credit-card-tracker"
   ```
3. **Replace `yourusername`** with your actual GitHub username
4. **Save the file**

### **Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages**

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the credit-card-tracker folder
cd credit-card-tracker

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

**What this does:**
- Builds your app for production
- Creates a `gh-pages` branch
- Pushes the built files to GitHub
- Makes your app live!

### **Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages**

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click "Settings"** tab
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** section
4. **Under "Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. **Select branch**: `gh-pages`
6. **Select folder**: `/ (root)`
7. **Click "Save"**

### **Step 6: Your App is Live! 🎉**

Your app will be available at:
**`https://yourusername.github.io/credit-card-tracker`**

**Note**: It may take 5-10 minutes for the first deployment to become live.
